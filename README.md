# CubeGate â€” Self-Hosted Minecraft Server Management Platform

**CubeGate** is an **open-source, self-hosted control panel** for managing and running **Minecraft servers** with Docker.  
It was built to provide a modern, developer-friendly, and efficient way to create, manage, and monitor Minecraft instances, all from a simple and elegant web interface.

## Overview

CubeGate lets you easily create and manage Minecraft servers on your own infrastructure.  
It aims to combine the simplicity of plug-and-play panels like Aternos with the power and flexibility of full Docker orchestration.

## Core Concepts

- **Self-Hosted by Design** â€” runs entirely on your server with Docker Compose.
- **Modular Architecture** â€” built with a clear separation between the **web panel** and a local **agent** that controls Docker.
- **Open Source Core** â€” transparent and extensible; ideal for developers, communities, and enthusiasts.
- **Future-Proof Foundation** â€” ready for scaling into a multi-node hosting environment later.
- **Minecraft-Focused** â€” built exclusively for Minecraft servers, with an emphasis on simplicity, performance, and automation.
- **Docker Based** â€” all Minecraft servers are isolated Docker containers based on the `itzg/minecraft-server` image.
